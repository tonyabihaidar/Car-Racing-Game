## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### 1. Database and Programming Approach
- Functional programming style
- Server-only DB access for security
- Password hashing with `bcrypt`
- `database.py` handles DB functions like credential creation, stats, leaderboards, etc.

### 2. Server Architecture
- Uses custom string format with rare separator (`***`)
- Messages define logic flow and data transmission

### 3. Email Verification
- Uses Python‚Äôs `smtplib` with Gmail app password
- Verification via code sent on signup

### 4. Music Management
- Background music stops with `pygame.mixer.music.stop()` on game over

### 5. Opponent Selection
- List of available, pending, accepted/declined players with UI interactivity
- Peer-to-peer confirmation before starting game

### 6. Multiplayer View
- Split-screen layout with mirrored environment
- Health, names, and timer at top

### 7. Health System
- Each obstacle has damage ("poison") value
- Health deducted on collision
- `getpoison()` fetches damage
- Triggers `game_over()` when health ‚â§ 0

### 8. Car Movement
- Controlled via arrow keys or A/D
- Limits prevent car from leaving screen

### 9. Collision Sound
- `pygame.mixer.Sound()` plays effect upon collision

### 10. Shooting
- Press spacebar to shoot
- Bullets move upward and destroy obstacles

### 11. Ammo Boxes
- Spawned periodically
- Colliding adds 3 bullets

### 12. Game Difficulty
- Partially scales obstacle speed (n)

### 13. Game Over Logic
- Triggers when health=0 or timer ends
- Displays stats, winner logic, plays sound

### 14. Car Customization
- Garage page to choose car from 16 colors

### 15. Network Connections
- TCP peer-to-peer for game data
- Main server assigns roles and facilitates matchmaking

### 16. Real-Time Game State Sync
- Live player state sharing each frame
- Asset caching for performance
